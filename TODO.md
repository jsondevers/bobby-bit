# TODO

- [ ] for checking range for blocks in bit torrent, we could potentially use a bloom filter
- [ ] fully test udp tracker on known torrents
- [ ] create an interface for a tracker that gets implemented by a udp or http client so we don't have to make a new client for each type of tracker
- [ ] fix potential blocking issue when creating a connection to a peer
